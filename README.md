========================

The elijah-lang compiler/package manager.

*tldr*: half-ass cegont-upper in the purpose of gh ci

`pr` is derived from problem-set-1004 with minimal extras, this repo notwithstanding.

Elijah is:

- ... not actually related to snakes.
- ... an intersting time-sink.
- ... free software (LGPL) intended for use on all systems, even Windows..

## Notes

1. Restored generic to Buffer.../Transform
2. Using internal NIE
3. Including commons-lang3 here like it is is "less than optimal".

## LICENSES

We are vendoring 

* commons-lang3 (Apache)
* antlr (prob public domain)
* jdeferred2 (prob LGPL2, maybe with classpath exception)
